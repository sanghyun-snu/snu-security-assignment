I exploit buffer overflow by "inserting large input string in stdin".

By using objdump, I found that <read_flag> function is called through <jump_to_here> which is located in 0x08048665.

So, I inserted input string consisting of repeating "\x04\x08\x65\x86" which is large enough to overwrite the return address.

A desired result is located in ./flag and a simple shell script I used to exploit is located in ./exploit.sh

Thank you.
